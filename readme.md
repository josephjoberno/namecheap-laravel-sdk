];
```

2. Add the facade to your aliases:

```php
'aliases' => [

    'Namecheap' => Namecheap\Laravel\Facades\Namecheap::class,
];
```

3. .env
``` bash \
NAMECHEAP_API_KEY=
NAMECHEAP_USERNAME=
NAMECHEAP_API_USER=
NAMECHEAP_CLIENT_IP=
NAMECHEAP_SANDBOX=
```
## Usage

You can use the Namecheap facade to interact with the Namecheap API:

```php
use Namecheap\Laravel\Facades\Namecheap;

// Example usage
$response = Namecheap::domains()->getList();
```
